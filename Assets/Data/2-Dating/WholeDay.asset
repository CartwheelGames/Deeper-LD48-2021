  _description: "You go out on another date and you don\u2019t mean to, but you spend
    the whole day together. You can\u2019t get enough. You feel yourself starting
    to like him too much. Do you ditch the date quickly at the end without a goodbye
    because you\u2019re too afraid of coming on too strong and liking him more than
    he likes you? Or do you ask to spend the night at his place so you can cuddle
    in bed?"
